See [http://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Processing] for more info.

## Contributing

To build:

1. Ensure you have [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) installed.
2. From the root directory, run: `ant`
   This will generate a few directories, but ultimately all you need is the updated
   processing-arduino.zip file.
3. Run: `ant clean` to remove the generated files and directories
